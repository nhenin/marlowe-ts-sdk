# Development

## Build

In order to start develop the SDK you need to install the dependencies and build the packages.

```
$ npm i
$ npm run build
```

If you want to build a single package you can use the `-w` flag or execute the build command from the package folder.

```
# From the root folder
$ npm run build -w @marlowe.io/language-core-v1
# Or you can enter the package and build
$ cd packages/language/core/v1
$ npm run build
```

In order to clean the build artifacts you can use the `clean` command.

```
$ npm run clean
```

To run the unit test you can execute the `test` command.

```
$ npm run test
```

## E2E tests

In order to run the E2E tests you need to create a `./env/.env.test` file that points to a working version of the marlowe runtime and a working Blockfrost instance and a faucet PK.

If you haven't done it before, go to https://blockfrost.io/ and create a free-tier account. Then, create a project and copy the project ID. Blockfrost is a Lucid dependency, eventually when
we migrate to a different library this wont be necessary.

To create an instance of a local marlowe runtime, follow the instructions in the [marlowe starter kit](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-starter-kit/blob/main/docs/preliminaries.md)

TODO: explain how to get the Faucet PK

```
MARLOWE_WEB_SERVER_URL="http://<path-to-runtime>:33294/"
BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID="<blockfrost-id>"
BLOCKFROST_URL="https://cardano-preprod.blockfrost.io/api/v0"
NETWORK_ID=Preprod
BANK_PK_HEX='<pk>'
```

## Documentation

> âš  You need to [build the packages](#build) before you can compile the documentation!

To compile all documentation

```
$ npm run docs
```

Documentation is built with [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org), published through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and hosted at https://input-output-hk.github.io/marlowe-ts-sdk

Each sub project needs a `typedoc.json` file in the sub project root directory as specified in the `workspaces` field in `./packages.json`. For example, there's some project "some-project" specified:

```json
// ./packages.json
{
  ...,
  "workspaces": ["./path/to/some-project"]
}
```

There needs to be a `typedoc.json` in `./path/to/some-project` and it needs properties along the lines of this example:

```json
// ./path/to/some-project/typedoc.json
{
  "entryPointStrategy": "expand",
  "entryPoints": ["./src"],
  "tsconfig": "./tsconfig.json"
}
```

### Changelogs

This project manages its changelog with [scriv](https://github.com/nedbat/scriv). PRs are automatically checked to see if there's a new entry in the `./changelog.d` folder. If a PR doesn't need a changelog entry, a `No Changelog Required` label can be added to disable the check.

Create a new changelog entry template with

```
$ scriv create
```

edit the new file with appropriate content for your PR and commit it. Read [the documentation for scriv](https://scriv.readthedocs.io/en) to learn more about how to use this tool.

To collect all changelog entries into a single file, execute `std` from the nix shell and run the `build-changelog` script. This command will delete all entries from the `changelog.d` folder and update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

## Publish

For the moment the SDK is manually published to npm. Task PLT-6939 captures the work to automate this process through the CI.

Before publishing it is convinient to check that the artifacts works as expected. To test this you can pack all the different packages into tarballs using

```bash
$ npm --workspaces pack --pack-destination dist
```

And in a separate project you can install the tarballs using a file url when declaring the dependency

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@marlowe.io/runtime-lifecycle": "file:<path-to-dist>/marlowe.io-runtime-lifecycle-0.2.0-alpha-0.tgz",
    "@marlowe.io/runtime-rest-client": "file:<path-to-dist>/marlowe.io-runtime-rest-client-0.2.0-alpha-0.tgz",
    "@marlowe.io/adapter": "file:<path-to-dist>/marlowe.io-adapter-0.2.0-alpha-0.tgz",
    "@marlowe.io/runtime-core": "file:<path-to-dist>/marlowe.io-runtime-core-0.2.0-alpha-0.tgz",
    "@marlowe.io/language-core-v1": "file:<path-to-dist>/marlowe.io-language-core-v1-0.2.0-alpha-0.tgz",
    "@marlowe.io/wallet": "file:<path-to-dist>/marlowe.io-wallet-0.2.0-alpha-0.tgz"
  }
}
```

TODO [[Publish pre-check]] Local map and this pack instructions
TODO instructions on how to manually publish
In order to check that the export/import mechanism works on the browser using import maps you can:

1. Create a testing branch in a fork of the repo
1. Clean and build the project `npm run clean && npm run build`
1. Remove `dist` from `.gitignore`
1. Commit the `dist` folders of the different packages
1. Get the full git hash of the commit using `git rev-parse HEAD`
1. Publish the branch in your fork
1. Modify `rollup/config.mjs` and set the correct `owner` and `version` when we build the import map for jsdelivr-gh.
1. Rebuild the project `npm run build`
1. Modify the html in the `pocs` folder to use `/dist/jsdelivr-gh-importmap.js`
1. From the root folder run `npx http-server --port 1337 -c-1  -o ./`
1. Verify that each poc example works properly.
